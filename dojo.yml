      - id: vscode
        name: Using the VSCode Workspace
        description: |
          Welcome to the dojo!
          This platform uses "flags" to track your progress.
          Flags are cryptographic tokens that are given to you when you solve challenges.
          The challenges themselves live in the `/challenge` directory.

          You can interact with the challenges in three ways:
          - You can use the Dojo Workspace, a version of VSCode running inside the dojo
          - You can use the Dojo Desktop, a full Linux GUI desktop running inside the dojo
          - You can set up your ssh client and ssh in

          We'll run you through the first two in this module, starting from the Workspace!
          Please start this challenge using the Start button, wait for confirmation that it started, and then click on the Workspace tab in the navigation bar!
          Once VSCode loads, launch a terminal (press `Control-Shift-Backtick` or click the `â˜°` button in VSCode's left panel, select the Terminal menu, and click New Terminal) and run the challenge!
          In this case, the challenge program is `/challenge/solve`.
          Just by running it in VSCode, you will get the flag!
          Once you see it, copy-paste it into the submission box below and submit!

      - id: desktop
        name: Using the GUI Desktop
        description: |
          Next, we will explore the Desktop!
          Start the challenge and click over to the Desktop on the navigation tab.
          This challenge requires you to run `/challenge/solve` from the terminal inside the Desktop.

      - id: desktop-paste
        name: Pasting into the Desktop
        description: |
          Next, we will learn to paste into the Desktop!
          You will need this secret token: `f8e5eb3178faf47ce5692f7f618e8f6f0e8769de7dd67ffe62b4375430a31e1b9d18a9574e8231e98572`

      - id: flag
        name: The Flag File
        description: |
          So far, the challenges have been giving you the flags directly.
          Now, you will learn that the flag actually lives in the `/flag` file.
          The `/flag` file is only readable to the challenge, because the challenge runs as the `root` user.
          Since you are the `hacker` user in the dojo, the only way to retrieve the flag is to solve the challenge.

          This challenge's `/challenge/solve` program will make the flag world-readable, but won't print it to you.
          You will need to read `/flag` yourself after running `/challenge/solve`.

      - id: practice
        name: Using Practice Mode
        description: |
          You can launch challenges in two modes, using the buttons below!
          So far, you have been using `Start`, which launches the challenge so that you can attempt to solve it for real.
          You can also `Practice`!
          This will grant you administrative privileges (via `sudo`) in the challenge container, allowing you greater capabilities to debug solutions and otherwise experiment with the challenge.

          You never *need* Practice mode to solve a challenge, except for this challenge, because it is designed to expose you to Practice mode.
          This challenge has a `/challenge/secret` file that is only readable by root, but it doesn't change between Practice mode and normal mode.
          To solve this challenge:
          - Launch the challenge in Practice mode.
          - Read the `/challenge/secret` file.
          - Relaunch the challenge in normal mode (using Start).
          - Provide the secret when `/challenge/solve` asks for it.

      - id: persist-1
        name: Persistent Home Directories - One
        description: |
          Your home directory in the dojo is persistent between challenges.
          This means that you can use it to build up notes across multiple challenges in a module, reference old solutions, or rerun solutions perfected in Practice mode against challenges in non-Practice mode.

          This challenge, and the next, will drive home the point by having you write a file in your home directory.
          Launch this challenge and follow its instructions!

      - id: persist-2
        name: Persistent Home Directories - Two
        description: |
          Now that you have created a file in your home directory, this challenge will use it!
          Launch this challenge and follow its instructions!
