      Two dojo concepts that this module does not yet cover are connecting over ssh and the VM.

      **Connecting over SSH.**
      In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to `Settings` > `SSH Key`.
      You can quickly generate an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''` in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine.
      This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your private and public keys respectively.
      Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can connect to the dojo host.
      For example, if your URL bar for this page reads `https://EXAMPLE.COM/welcome/welcome`, you would run `ssh -i key hacker@EXAMPLE.COM` to connect into your challenge instance.

      **The VM.**
      For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine.
      You can interact with the virtual machine using the `vm` command.
