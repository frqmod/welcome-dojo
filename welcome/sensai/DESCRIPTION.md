The challenges in pwn.college can be tricky and, oftentimes, you might get stuck!
There are several ways to get yourself unstuck:

1. Thing for a long time. This will reinforce knowledge and build experience that will help you think through future problems!
2. Search online for help. This is a critical skill, and you will need to develop it over the course of working through pwn.college.
3. Ask for help.

There are two resources to ask for help. The first is our discord, full of amazing hackers who are willing to help with trickier issues. But for many typical issues you will run into, there is SENSAI, your AI-powered sensei for the dojo.

SENSAI is an LLM that is augmented with information about the challenge, common issues people run into with the challenge, and your actual terminal and filesystem state.
This means that it can be an effective help for many issues, and can help bridge knowledge gaps that might be hampering your progress!

This challenge will force you to interact with SENSAI.
SENSAI can be accessed through the [Help](/sensai) link in the navigation bar at the top of the page!
Access it only *after* launching the challenge.
