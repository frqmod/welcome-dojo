Your home directory in the dojo is persistent between challenges.
This means that you can use it to build up notes across multiple challenges in a module, reference old solutions, or rerun solutions perfected in Practice mode against challenges in non-Practice mode.

This challenge, and the next, will drive home the point by having you write a file in your home directory.
Launch this challenge and follow its instructions!
