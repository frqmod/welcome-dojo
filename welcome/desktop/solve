You should be running this challenge through the terminal program in the
GUI Desktop... Let's check!
END

echo -n "Checking"
for i in {1..10}
do
	echo -n "."
	sleep 0.1
done
echo -n $'\r'

if [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "vscode" ] && [ "$TERM" == "xterm-256color" ]
then
	echo "PASSED! You are running in the Desktop!"
	echo -n "Your flag: "
	cat /flag
	cat <<END

Now, copy your flag out of the Desktop! This takes some work. The steps:

1. Select the flag with your mouse.
2. Right click, Copy the flag.
3. The flag is now in the dojo's clipboard, but not your system's clipboard!
4. Click on the ▸ button on the left edge of the Desktop.
5. Click on the Clipboard button. The Dojo's clipboard will appear!
6. You can now copy these contents to get them into your system's clipboard!
7. After copying the contents, paste them into the flag submission box!
END

	echo "NOPE! Run this challenge from the Desktop (rather than VSCode or SSH)!"
